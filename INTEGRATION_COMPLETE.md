## Technical Implementation

### Backend Integration
- ✅ Added `get_stockopedia_rating()` function to both development and production Flask apps
- ✅ Integrated Stockopedia API call into `/get_ratings` endpoint
- ✅ Implemented robust error handling and timeout management
- ✅ Added category mapping for better user understanding

- ✅ Implemented `updateStockopediaCard()` function for specialized handling
- ✅ Updated consensus algorithm to include all four platforms
- ✅ Added CSS styles for Stockopedia categories (Excellent/Good/Average/Poor/Very Poor)

### Data Quality
- ✅ StockRank provides granular 1-100 scoring vs simple ratings
- ✅ Style classifications add valuable context (High Flyer, Falling Star, etc.)
- ✅ Clean JSON extraction from embedded page data
- ✅ No rate limiting or blocking issues (unlike GuruFocus)

## Consensus Analysis Algorithm

The updated consensus algorithm now considers all four platforms:

1. **Positive Signals**: Strong Buy, Buy, Outperform, Excellent, Good
2. **Neutral Signals**: Hold, Neutral, Average
3. **Negative Signals**: Sell, Strong Sell, Underperform, Poor, Very Poor

Results:
- **🔥 BUY CONSENSUS**: Majority recommend buying
- **📊 HOLD CONSENSUS**: Majority recommend holding
- **⚠️ SELL CONSENSUS**: Majority recommend selling
- **🤔 MIXED SIGNALS**: No clear consensus

## Files Updated

### Backend
- `stock_rating_app.py` - Development Flask app
- `stock_rating_app_production.py` - Production Flask app

### Frontend

## Access
